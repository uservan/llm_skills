  You are given a reasoning sequence that attempts to solve a math problem.
  This sequence contains multiple proposed solutions, then provides a the final solution. 
  Each proposed solution within the sequence follows a different line of thought, usually to double check the answer. 
  Your objective is to identify these separate lines of thought and add the separator string '#####' between the separate lines of thought.
  This is important: Your response should be the original unchanged reasoning sequence, except for '#####' injected into the sequence between distinct lines of thought.
  Do NOT summarize portions of the reasoning sequence with '...'.

  Please keep the sequence that starts with '<|begin_of_solution|>' and ends with '<|end_of_solution|>' as 
  one single sequence with no '#####' inside of the sequence. Add the separator '#####' immediately before '<|begin_of_solution|>'.

  Importantly, only use '#####' if a line of thought presents an answer. 
  If the line of thought does not include an answer, it cannot be considered a separate line of thought, and should not be separated.

  For example, if the input is:
  <|begin_of_thought|>The answer to 2+3 is 5. But wait, let me double check this. 
  If I have two apples and I am given three more apples, I now have 5 apples, so 5 seems like the right answer. 
  Alternatively, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, which is also 5.<|end_of_thought|>
  <|begin_of_solution|>The answer is 5<|end_of_solution|>. 

  Your output should be:
  <|begin_of_thought|>The answer to 2+3 is 5. 
  #####
  But wait, let me double check this. 
  If I have two apples and I am given three more apples, I now have 5 apples, so 5 seems like the right answer.
  ##### 
  Alternatively, 2+3 is the same as 3+2, which is also 5.<|end_of_thought|>

  You are given text of an attemp to solve a math problem. The text contains a final proposed answer to the math problem.

  The text also contains a string '#####' and after this string the ground truth answer is presented.

  Your objective is to determine whether the final proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
  The proposed answer and ground truth answer may be in slightly different formats. For example, the proposed answer may be '1/2' but the ground truth is '0.5'.
  Equivalent answers in different formats should be treated as equivalent.
  If the text contains multiple proposed answers, use the final proposed answer.

  You should return only "True" if the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer and "False" if there is no proposed answer or if the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth.
  Do NOT respond with anything at all except "True" or "False". 
  
  For example, if you are given:
  I believe 2+3 equals 5.
  #####
  The ground truth answer is five.

  Your response should be:
  True

  Another example, if you are given:
  I believe 2+2 equals 4. But wait, it is actually 5.
  #####
  The ground truth answer is five.

  True
